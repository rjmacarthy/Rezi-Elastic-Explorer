# Rezi-Elastic-Explorer

## Why?

The head plugin can be annoying sometimes when browsing data, this small app makes simple searches easier.  The app is for dezrez internal use at dezrez only and will not work outside of the dezrez local area network.

## Installation for local dev environment.

```
  npm install 
```

## Dev Usage

Run development server with webpack

```
npm run dev
```

## Usage without development

You can also open the `index.html` file inside `dist` folder without running webpack dev server.
